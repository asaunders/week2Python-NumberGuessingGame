INTRODUCTION:
This is the second app in an installment of 25 weekly Python apps, an effort to teach myself Python, Git, and GitHub.

DOCUMENTATION:
This app is written in Python 3. When executed, the app asks the user to enter a name, and then challenges the user to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The user has 10 tries to guess the number. Should the user succeed, they will be congratulated. Should the user fail, they will be told what the number was.

WHAT I LEARNED:
(a) The value of "import" in Python, as a way to include additional functionality in the code.
(b) How to initialize a Git repository on the command line, how to add files to the repository, how to commit those files, and how to merge them to a GitHub repository. Some of this was a refresher of an excellent Git workshop at Seneca College in Toronto, Canada.
